# SiderealMind

### SiderealMind is a web application that combines various technologies to offer users a unique experience. It integrates React for the front end, Node.js for the back end, and NASA APIs to provide users with the ability to select a historical date and explore NASA's events and images associated with that day. Furthermore, the platform allows users to share their experiences, like other users' experiences, and access resources such as breathing lessons and meditations to promote mental well-being.

### Key Technologies:
In the development of Sidereal-Mind, we leveraged a diverse set of technologies, each playing a crucial role:

JavaScript: Employed to enhance the front-end, delivering dynamic interactivity and creating a user-friendly interface.
React: Recognized for its ability to construct interactive and dynamic UI components, React served as the primary library for web application development.
MongoDB: Served as the core database management system.
Postman: Facilitated API testing and validation, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our APIs.
Bootstrap and CSS: Used to craft impressive and responsive styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
Node.js for the backend.

### Challenges Faced:
During the development process, we encountered several challenges that provided valuable learning experiences, including:

Passing data between components in React.
Resolving GitHub conflicts.

### Future Plans:
Our future plans for the Sidereal-Mind platform encompass the following:

* Restructuring the StorySharing component for enhanced functionality.
* Design refinements to enhance the overall aesthetic.
* Adding additional features, such as music, guided meditation, breathwork exercises, and sacred geometry.
